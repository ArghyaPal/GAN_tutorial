# Generative Adversarial Networks Presentation by Dr. Arghya Pal
In this presentation, we will discuss both the fundamentals and the advanced topics of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We will largly cover the following topics those are necesssary to understand GANs:


1. Generative Models
2. High-level introduction to GANs
3. Math background
4. Drawbacks of vanilla GANs
5. Variations of GANs
6. Evaluation of GAN

Pls download the presentation slide: ``Dr_Arghya_Pal_FDP_NITW_GAN_2021.pptx``. You are free to use this material for your class lecture and other talks. Feel free to distributre and spread the knowledge.

Pls dowload the code: ``GAN_Tutorial.ipynb``. You can directly run the code on Google colab (using the link ``open it in Colab``) and check the results. On the Colab page, pls change the ``Runtime`` --> ``change runtime type`` --> and check the ``harware accelaration`` to GPU to use the flavour of "running GPU for a code". 

If you like this page, pls give this page a STAR (top right middle button) to appriciate my effort. Thanks!
