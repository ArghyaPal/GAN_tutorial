# Generative Adversarial Networks Presentation by Dr. Arghya Pal
In this presentation, we will discuss both the fundamentals and the advanced topics of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We will largly cover the following topics those are necesssary to understand GANs:


1. Generative Models
2. High-level introduction to GANs
3. Math background
4. Drawbacks of vanilla GANs
5. Variations of GANs
6. Evaluation of GAN
