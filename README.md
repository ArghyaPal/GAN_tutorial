# Generative Adversarial Networks Presentation by Dr. Arghya Pal
This presentation will discuss both the fundamentals and the advanced topics of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We will essentially cover the following topics that are necessary to understand GANs:


1. Generative Models
2. High-level introduction to GANs
3. Math background
4. Drawbacks of vanilla GANs
5. Variations of GANs
6. Evaluation of GAN

Pls download the presentation slide: ``Dr_Arghya_Pal_FDP_NITW_GAN_2021.pptx``. You are free to use this material for your class lectures and other talks. Feel free to distribute and spread the knowledge.

Pls, download the code: ``GAN_Tutorial.ipynb``. You can directly run the code on Google colab (using the link ``open it in Colab``) and check the results. On the Colab page, pls change the ``Runtime`` --> ``change runtime type`` --> and check the ``hardware acceleration`` to GPU to use the flavor of "running GPU for a code." 

If you like this page, pls give this page a STAR (top right middle button) to appreciate my effort. Thanks!
